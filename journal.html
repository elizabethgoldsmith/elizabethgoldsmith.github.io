	<h1> My Coding Journal!</h1>
	<h3>October 24, 2019</h3>
	<p>I pushed my coding journal online and worked on my design for the computer science lab!</p>
	<h3>October 25, 2019</h3>
	<p>I worked on my coding jornal and created a computer science room design website!</p>
	<h3>October 28, 2019</h3>
	<p>I worked on my candy vending machine projects and added some finishing touches to my coding website!</p>
	<h3>October 30, 2019</h3>
	<p>I worked on my candy vending machine website. I tried to use java script to make the candy draggable with the goal of being able to drag candy into a shopping cart.</p>
	<h3>November 11, 2019</h3>
	<p>I worked onmy candy machine and made a code that allows you to select the candy you want and place it in the cart. I still need to figure out a way to make it drag into the cart.</p>
	<h3>November 12, 2019</h3>
	<p>I worked on my candy mechine layout and coded a program in sketch. The program writes out numbers 1-100 but for every multiple of 3 says "fizz" every multiple of 5 says "buzz" and every multiple of 15 says "fuzzbuzz" instead of the number. </p>

	<h3>November 16, 2019</h3>
	<p>Today I reserched different ways to make a div draggable in javascript for my candy machine project.</p>
	<h3>November 20, 2019</h3>
	<p>Today I went for a lab to work on my cnady vending machine and made significant progress. The divs now are all movable by clicking on the one you choose to select. I also adjusted the coordinates of the divs to have them appear centered over the mouse where you click but I still need to figure out a way to have this happen when you are not scrolled to the very top of the page.</p>
	<h3>November 26, 2019</h3>
	<p>Today in class I made a random dog generator that when you click on the screen randomly gives you a picture of a cute funny dog</p>
	<h3>December 10, 2019</h3>
	<p>In class recently we have been working with java script a bunch. We had an assignment to create a small project in javascript and I linked to to my projects page</p>
	<h3>December 15, 2019</h3>
	<p>Today I worked a lot on trying to make the divs in my candy machine draggable instead of simp,y clicking and placing. I didn't start making a function but I spent a lot of time reading on W3 Schools and I think next time I have enough time I will be able to start making a function</p>
	<h3>December 17, 2019</h3>
	<p>In class we discussed our project ideas and I linked a list of my ideas to my project section of my home page</p>
	<h3>December 19, 2019</h3>
	<p>Today I started my function to make the divs draggable instead of click and place in my chandy machine project. I made a function that I thought would work correctly and I think I'm on the right track I just need to work the issues out.</p>
	<h3>December 22, 2019</h3>
	<p>Today overbreak I got board and figured I could put my time to good use by editing and bettering my rnadom dog generaton. I added more dogs and and made the appearence of the project more appealing.</p>
	<h3>January 7, 2020</h3>
	<p>Today was our first class back after break. We spoke about potential class projects we could complete and different ideas for fun things to make. We did a javascript lesson and spent time translating the javascript into english.</p>
	<h3>January 15, 2020</h3>
	<p>Yesterday we had class and we talked some more about projects we could complete. I thought making a live temple run using makey makey's could be a fun idea. In addition, was talked about making a picture book with drawings and stories we could present to the younger kids at little dalton.</p>
	<h3>January 28, 2020</h3>
	<p>We had class today and we started making our "magic tricks". I am making one that randomly places thousands of gummy worms thtoughout the screen. I am having a little trouble getting them to reposition using a button rather than just reloading the entire page. The script works by creating a variable for me it's worms and randomly placing them throughout the screen every 100 millaseconds. I still need to create and erase button to clear all of the worms.</p>
	<h3>February 4, 2020</h3>
	<p>Ella helped me add a clear button to my website that added and event listener for when a div called "clear" was clicked. When it is clicked the event listener sets all of the worms on the screen to have an opacity of 0</p>
	<h3>Febuary 12, 2020</h3>
	<p>I made a random picture generator of my dog for my family as a valentine. I saved all of the pictures to my desktop and named them teddynumber1-20.png so I could create a function that randomly displays them. This function is in javascript and uses an event listener "when click" to get a picture to appear randomly. I then added little details to make the website more appealing like adding a dotted border and changing the font. I want to figure out if there is a way to make the dotted border and imagine instead of plain hearts so I can make it hearts or something cute like that</p>
	<h3>Febuary 19, 2020</h3>
	<p>Today I started trying to come up with ideas for my next project. I looked at the 180 days of coding website and inspected the code from many of the sketches posted to figure out if there was anything original I could do with aspects of the code that I wouldn't have been able to think of on my own. I found a few projects on that website that I think I will be able to use to help be create a fun game or interactive site.</p>
