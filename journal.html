	<h1> My Coding Journal!</h1>
	<h3>October 24, 2019</h3>
	<p>I pushed my coding journal online and worked on my design for the computer science lab!</p>
	<h3>October 25, 2019</h3>
	<p>I worked on my coding jornal and created a computer science room design website!</p>
	<h3>October 28, 2019</h3>
	<p>I worked on my candy vending machine projects and added some finishing touches to my coding website!</p>
	<h3>October 30, 2019</h3>
	<p>I worked on my candy vending machine website. I tried to use java script to make the candy draggable with the goal of being able to drag candy into a shopping cart.</p>
	<h3>November 11, 2019</h3>
	<p>I worked onmy candy machine and made a code that allows you to select the candy you want and place it in the cart. I still need to figure out a way to make it drag into the cart.</p>
	<h3>November 12, 2019</h3>
	<p>I worked on my candy mechine layout and coded a program in sketch. The program writes out numbers 1-100 but for every multiple of 3 says "fizz" every multiple of 5 says "buzz" and every multiple of 15 says "fuzzbuzz" instead of the number. </p>

	<h3>November 16, 2019</h3>
	<p>Today I reserched different ways to make a div draggable in javascript for my candy machine project.</p>
	<h3>November 20, 2019</h3>
	<p>Today I went for a lab to work on my cnady vending machine and made significant progress. The divs now are all movable by clicking on the one you choose to select. I also adjusted the coordinates of the divs to have them appear centered over the mouse where you click but I still need to figure out a way to have this happen when you are not scrolled to the very top of the page.</p>
